This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`]
I am using Clerk for authentication and Prisma for database.
## Getting Started

First , Initialize the project

```bash
npm install
```

Next, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

if you want to run the project locally on your machine, after running the development server, open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
